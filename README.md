# CryptoClustering.
I created a unsupervised learning model to predict if cryptocurrencies are affected by 24-hour or 7-day price changes. I clustered the cryptocurrencies for the best value for k on the original scaled data and performed a PCA and reduce the features to three principal components. Then I compared the k values for each datasets as well as the elbow curve for each data set.
